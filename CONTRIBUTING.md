# Contributing

Prometheus uses GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.

* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.

* If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas
  on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/prometheus-developers).
  This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal
  of inspiration.

* Be sure to sign your commits off (per the [DCO](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works)) by including `--signoff` as a parameter to your `git commit` commands.
